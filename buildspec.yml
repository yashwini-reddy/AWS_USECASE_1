phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - echo "Starting build..."
      - echo "No build steps required for static HTML, directly zipping files."
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo "Build complete. Preparing artifacts for deployment."
      # No need for a manual zip command here if using base-directory and discard-paths

artifacts:
  files:
    - '**/*'             # Include all files and subdirectories
  base-directory: '.'    # Specify that the current directory is the source of files
  discard-paths: yes     # Crucial: This tells CodeBuild to discard the leading '.' path from files in the artifact.
  # The artifact will be created as a zip by CodeBuild automatically when using 'files' and 'base-directory'.
  # The 'name' field below is optional, but good practice.
  name: website_artifact # This is the name of the artifact produced (e.g., website_artifact.zip)
